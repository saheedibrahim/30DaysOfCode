/*DAY 16: LETS GO UP

Deploy a script to any hosting service of your choice. When the API endpoint link is terminated with "/primes" and accessed, a string response with the first 20 prime numbers is sent back with appropriate response header.

Apply best practices for your backend architecture(file structure) as a mentor might want to evaluate this.

NB: Heroku might be a good place to deploy your script*/
